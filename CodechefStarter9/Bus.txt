/** We just have to make sure two conditions are met:
1. Number of passengers in the bus should be smaller or equal to m.
2. The person leaving the bus should be present in the bus in the first place.
I am taking a marker for the people currently in bus and when someone is leaving, I am checking if that person
was there in the bus.
For the first condition I am taking a count for the number of people inside the bus, if at any point that exceeds
m, we are moving to the inconsistency condition.

The question is straight forward we are given the nutrients required from coconut A and B and the nutrient found 
in one of  these types, we have to find the number of coconuts required, it would be Xatotal/xaindividual + Xbtotal/xbindividual
The only corner case would have been when we get a floating number after division but that doesn't matter here
as we are already given the information that the division is perfect

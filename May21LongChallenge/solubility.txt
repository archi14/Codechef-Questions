/** Initial solubility at x temp is a/100gm, since the amount of water is constant i.e 1 liter,
we could say that solubility as x temp is 10a, and max temperature that could be achieved is 100 and at each degree
solubility increases by b/100gm i.e 10b and temp difference would be 100-x. so using all these things max amount that
could be soluble is (100-x)*10*b+10*a, giving us a straigthforward answer for all the testcases.

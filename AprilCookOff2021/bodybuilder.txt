Mistakes
1. First mistake I did in this is I didn't read the question properly and in haste I thought we have to calculate the total stress at the end of the workout.
2. Keep in mind the type of the stress and other variables that won't be encompassed by int.

In this question, we have to get the max stress the builder experiences during his/her workout.
i.e. max(max_stress, current_stress) for all i for 0 to n;
